# QAOA with Grover Mixers.

## TODO:

- Debora: Make a main file
- Paul: Remove struct that holds probabilities as real values instead of complex amplitudes (no conversion needed), save exact probability vs approximation ratio to an external file for plotting in python
- Lennart: 
- Soren: add instances

## FUTURE TODOS

- comparison mixers
- check instances for gate count (qtg vs rasmus)
