# QAOA with Grover Mixers.

## TODO:

- Look for bugs: printing test (Soeren), optimizers (Debora)
- find comparison method (litterature review), start with rasmus but look for state of the art (Paul, Lennart)
- new plot as number of items x axis

## FUTURE TODOS

- comparison mixers
- check instances for gate count (qtg vs rasmus)
