# QAOA with Grover Mixers.

## TODO:

- Debora: generate toy examples upper limit for qubits, look how optimizers behave from approx ratio
- Paul: save exact probability vs approximation ratio to an external file for plotting in python, minor changes to file, gate count
- Lennart: plotting
- Soren: add more instances, anti aggression course, 

## FUTURE TODOS

- comparison mixers
- check instances for gate count (qtg vs rasmus)
