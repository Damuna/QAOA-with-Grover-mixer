# QAOA with Grover Mixers.

## TODO:

- Debora:
- Paul: tranfer qaoa python in c
- Lennart:
- Soren: 

## FUTURE TODOS

- Optimizers and combine
- go from 0 capacity to full and see what it is better (change gate count)
- comparison mixers

- add optimizers as git submodules
- find optimazires that use Cmake instead of makefile (maybe)
- redo the makefile as Cmake
- check instances for gate count (qtg vs rasmus)
